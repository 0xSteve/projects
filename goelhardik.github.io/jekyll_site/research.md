<strong>Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Anomaly Detection</strong> *(Nov 2016 - Present)* <br />
*Technology*: Python
 <br/>
*Description*: Investigating an Inverse Reinforcement Learning based framework for anomaly detection in time-series aviation data.

<strong>Multivariate Time-Series Modeling with Deep Learning</strong> *(May 2016 - Oct 2016)* <br />
*Technology*: Python, Theano, Lasagne
 <br/>
*Description*: Time-series forecasting on aviation data. Performed careful empirical comparison between Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based models (standard LSTM and sequential autoencoders) for time-series prediction.

These are the plots of some sections of the original data and the predictions made by VARs and LSTMs.
As can be seen from the plots above, VARs outperformed LSTMs in future time-series prediction. This can be attributed to multiple factors including the simplicity of the dataset and difficulty of training LSTMs. More details are discussed in the paper (currently under review).
