<strong>Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Toy-Car game</strong> *(Nov 2016 - Dec 2016)* <br />
*Technology*: Python
 <br/>
*Description*: Implemented Deep Q-Learning from scratch to train a toy-car game player. Also, implemented Apprenticeship Learning for expert mimicking without explicit rewards.

<strong>GPU-based ADMM implementation for Robust PCA</strong> *(Oct 2016 - Dec 2016)* <br />
*Technology*: C++, CUDA
 <br/>
*Description*: Implemented a GPU-based parallel version of Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for Robust PCA. The application was foreground-background separation, done using low-rank matrix approximation.

<strong>Automatic Musical Chord Recognition</strong> *(Oct 2016 - Dec 2016)* <br />
*Technology*: Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras
 <br/>
*Description*: Built a machine learning based system for automatic chord recognition from raw audio. By exploiting chord-progression information, using LSTMs, obtained a classification accuracy of close to 74%.

<strong>C-- Compiler</strong> *(Feb 2016 - Apr 2016)* <br />
*Technology*: C, Flex, Bison
 <br/>
*Description*: : Implemented all the parts of a compiler - lexical analyzer, parser, semantic analyzer, type checker and code
generator - for a C-like language (without pointers). 

<strong>Othello Game Playing Bot</strong> *(Dec 2015)* <br />
*Technology*: Python
 <br/>
*Description*: Designed an AI system using adversary search algorithms and scoring heuristics to play the game of Othello. Also wrote a [Tic Tac Toe](http://tictactoeapp.herokuapp.com/) game for humans to play against an unbeatable bot.
